This lib contains:

    -   jamod (Java Modbus Library) http://jamod.sourceforge.net/
        Version: 1.2
        Published under the BSD license

    -   purejavacomm
        Version: 1.0
        Published under the BSD license

Since purejavacomm is not available in maven central, the code is copied into this artifact (because of the "no-foreign-repository" policy).

There are also some modifications to get valid tests and valid javadoc.
